# Requirements
## Software
* [ ] [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [ ] [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (Any version below wouldn't work, but you can install them in parallel)
* [ ] [CodeMeter User Runtime (Version 8.x)](https://www.wibu.com/de/support/anwendersoftware/anwendersoftware.html)

## Get all your licenses running
The application developer program uses developer licenses. The licenses end on WibuCmRaU. You need the CodeMeter Control Center, where you can add those files via drag and drop. This can be downloaded from the Wibu website directly.
For a scenario in which you want to use production licenses you may consider installing the PHOENIX CONTACT Activation Wizard available on the [PHOENIX CONTACT page](https://www.phoenixcontact.com/de-de/produkte/programmier-software-plcnext-engineer-1046008) under Downloads -> Software.
